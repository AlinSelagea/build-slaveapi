Wanted info:
- Is slave running a job?
- is slave running buildbot? is it connected?

Clients needed:
- inventory
- bugzilla
- more slavealloc stuff

Other:
- Panda/Tegra reboots.
-- Use mozpool?
- Figure where and how to log events; retrieve them.
-- Maybe slavealloc db? A different db?
- Query API for status of command
- Can we wait and return data for some cheaper commands, rather than making them do requests?
-- Can we have a timeout and add a jobid later?
